## TIC-TAC-TOE Project

For this project we were desginated to create a tic tac toe game where the user verses
themselves by clicking either "X" or "O" in the squares provided. We had to determine
a winner between either "X" or "O", as well as a tie game.

## Development Process

- Starting this project I initially used my wire frame to lay down a basic tic tac toe
layout through HTML with some CSS styling.
- I then began working on the user API with creating a signIn / signUp login while also
working on some JavaScript functions.
- Continued working on JavaScript to complete game functionality and once this was
figured out I began working on the game API.
- Worked on the games API by using the store.js to have data collected and using ajax to send a request to the server.
As we play the game it is constantly being updated with user data such as a games id, a value of 'X' or 'O',
an index of where in the array the move was made, and over to determine if the game
was completed or not and we are sent back response data from the server.
- Finally, I worked on the styling of the game with CSS and made the user experience appealing.


## WireFrames / User Stories

- As a new user, I would like to smoothly create a username that will save my progress
with wins and losses so that I can see my stats.
- As a concurrent user, I want to sign in easily and jump right into the game,
as well as be able to start a new game upon winning or losing so I can keep playing.
- As a new user to tic-tac-toe, I would like a list of instructions on how to
play so I can enhance my skill.
- As a frequent user, I would like a nice prompt message telling me I have won/lost
to urge me to continue playing.

## Future Additions

- Create a user vs. computer AI mode.
- Be able to track the amount of games each specific user has played, and their
wins / losses.
